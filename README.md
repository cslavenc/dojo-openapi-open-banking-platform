# dojo-openapi-open-banking-platform

In this dojo, we take a look at OpenAPI and how contract-first principles help us create RESTful APIs in a more
consistent and stable manner.

## Introduction

Read the system description of a fictive company called Alpine Banking AG which expresses its needs, wishes and
requirements to build an open banking platform in `PROPOSAL.md`. Based on the text, create an openapi specification.
Check the API endpoints in `SAMPLE.md` for a possible interpretation of the text. The `diagrams` folder contains a class
and entity relationship diagram as a help to visualize the description.
