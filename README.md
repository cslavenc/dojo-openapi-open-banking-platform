# dojo-openapi-open-banking-platform

In this dojo, we take a look at OpenAPI and how contract-first principles help us create RESTful APIs in a more
consistent and stable manner.

## Introduction

Read the system description of a fictive company called Alpine Banking AG which expresses its needs, wishes and
requirements to build an open banking platform in `DESCRIPTION.md`. Based on the text, create an openapi specification.
Check the API endpoints in `SAMPLE.md` for a possible interpretation of the text. The `diagrams` folder contains a class
and entity relationship diagram as a help to visualize the description. In the end, return default data from a
controller in [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html). The exercise folders provide skeleton code for
controller and data classes which you can freely modify and adapt.

## Challenge

The examples and solutions are implemented for java, dotnet and python. Try the same on your own for:

- nodejs
- c++
- rust
- go

Contributions are always welcome!
