# Getting started

The `solution` folder contains an example implementation of the API which returns static data.

## Hints

- in Spring Boot, go to the `target` folder and open all subfolder in the `openapi` and `src` directory. Right-click on
  the `java` folder and mark it as a generated sources root to enable short imports in regular files.
