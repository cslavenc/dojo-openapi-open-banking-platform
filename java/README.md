# Getting started

The `solution` folder contains an example implementation of the API which returns static data. The exercise code
contains a skeleton of REST controller code. Feel free to modify the skeleton code as you see fit.

## Hints

- [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html)
- in Spring Boot, go to the `target` folder and open all subfolder in the `openapi` and `src` directory. Right-click on
  the `java` folder and mark it as a generated sources root to enable short imports in regular files.
